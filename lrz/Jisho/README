Jisho is a Japanese dictionary tool, based on the very excellent JMDict 
project. See the LICENSE file for licensing details.

Current version is 1.0. Further releases will be available from the following
SVN repository:

https://rubycocoa.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rubycocoa/branches/users/lrz/Jisho

== Features ==

- Embed the very excellent EDICT dictionary, under its XML flavor (JMDict).

- Can search by providing English, Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji criterion.

- Results show the Kanji first, followed by the possible Kana representations.
  The English translation comes next.

- You can increate the font size and go back and forward through the 
  searched entries in the history.

- Jisho registers a service that you can use to request translations from 
  other applications. For example, select a word in Safari, and click on
  the application menu, then "Services" and "Lookup in Jisho". You can activate
  this using the ``command+t'' keyboard shortcut.

== Build requirements ==

In order to build and use Jisho, you need:

1) Mac OS X 10.4.8 or later

2) One of the recents RubyCocoa 1.0 pre-releases. You can grab one at:

   http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/doc/unstable/

3) Ferret. Installable from RubyGems using:

   gem install ferret

4) Libxml-ruby 0.4.0-pre-01 or later. Available from:

   http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=494 

Once you have all those pieces installed on your machine, you can build Jisho
by running: 

   $ xcodebuild

This should leave a Jisho.app bundle in your build directory, depending of 
your Xcode configuration.

== Generating the Ferret index ==

Once you run Jisho for the first time, it will index the contents of the 
XML-based JMDict dictionary into a Ferret index. During the indexing the
popular pizza-of-the-death will appear. This should take from 10 to 20 minutes,
depending of your hardware.

The indexing is obviously performed only once. The path of the index file is:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Jisho/index

If you remove the `index' sub-directory, Jisho will re-generate it the next 
time it is started.

== Support ==

I wrote this small project to experiment both the XML::Reader APIs and the 
Ferret indexing engine. I do not plan to provide extensive support on this 
project. If you run into a problem, please try to find what's wrong by 
yourself.

If you still don't know what's going wrong, feel free to drop me a message, but
do not hold your breath for a quick response:
