== RubyInject ==

RubyInject is a Mac OS X framework that allows you to inject at runtime the
Ruby interpreter into any running application, using the mach_star mechanism.

It will spawn a new thread on the remote process, initialize the Ruby
interpreter, start a new DRb server that exposes an expression evaluator, and
advertises the DRb server URI on bonjour (if you have the ruby-dnssd library).

== Requirements ==

- Mac OS X 10.5.
- RubyCocoa 0.13.0 or later.

== Installation ==

RubyInject comes in 2 parts. First is the framework, that you can build and
install:

$ xcodebuild SYMROOT=/tmp
$ cp -r /tmp/Release/RubyInject.framework /Library/Frameworks

The second part is the client, which uses the framework to inject Ruby, then
waits on bonjour to connect to the DRb server. It is a Ruby script named
inject.rb. 

You can manually copy inject.rb in one of the directories of your $PATH,
or simply call it from the RubyInject project directory.

== Usage ==

$ sudo ruby inject.rb <pid> <ruby-script>

<pid> is the process ID of the application you want to inject Ruby to.

<ruby-script> is the path of a Ruby script that will be directly evaluated
after the injection. This is optional, if this parameter is not used an IRB 
session will be started instead.
