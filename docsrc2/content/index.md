# What is RubyCocoa ?

RubyCocoa is a framework for [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)
that allows [Cocoa](http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/) programming
in the object-oriented scripting language [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).

RubyCocoa lets you write a Cocoa application in Ruby. It allows you to create
and use a Cocoa object in a Ruby script. It's possible to write a
Cocoa application that mixes Ruby and Objective-C code.

Some useful applications of RubyCocoa:

  * Exploration of a Cocoa object's features with `irb` interactively
  * Prototyping of a Cocoa application
  * Writing a Cocoa application that combines good features of Ruby and Objective-C
  * Wrapping Mac OS X's native GUI for a Ruby script
