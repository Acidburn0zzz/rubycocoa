ruby_thread_hooks.diff *must* be applied if you want to use Ruby threads with
RubyCocoa.

The patch can be theoretically applied to any Ruby 1.8.x release (works fine 
with 1.8.6 and even with the latest patchlevel releases).

Versions of Ruby below 1.8.x are not supported.

The patch doesn't need to be applied before building RubyCocoa.
