We provide binaries of libruby 1.8.2 that have been already patched with the
ruby-thread-hook patches. 

These binaries are meant to replace Apple's version of Ruby in Tiger.

== INSTALL ==

1. Decompress the tarball for your architecture:

   libruby.1.dylib-tiger-ppc.tar.gz: 	For Tiger PPC architecture.
   libruby.1.dylib-tiger-i386.tar.gz: 	For Tiger Intel architecture.

   (We cannot distribute only one binary for both architecture, because the
    Ruby load path is not the same _and_ is hardcoded in the binary.)

2. Copy the resulted binary as /usr/lib/libruby.1.dylib. Make a backup of the
   previous version before.
