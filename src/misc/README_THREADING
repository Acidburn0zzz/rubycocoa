== Using Ruby Threads with RubyCocoa ==

Using Ruby threads to call Objective-C APIs may result in random crashes 
unless the Ruby interpreter has been patched.

For the rationale behind this problem, please read:

http://lists.sourceforge.jp/mailman/archives/rubycocoa-devel/2006-August/000373.html

We strongly recommend you to patch your version of Ruby if you plan to write
RubyCocoa threading code.

== Binaries ==

We provide binaries of libruby 1.8.2 that have been already patched.

These binaries are meant to replace Apple's version of Ruby in Tiger.

Installation is simple:

1. Decompress the tarball for your architecture:

   libruby.1.dylib-tiger-ppc.tar.gz:    For Tiger PPC architecture.
   libruby.1.dylib-tiger-i386.tar.gz:   For Tiger Intel architecture.

   (We cannot distribute only one binary for both architecture, because the
    Ruby load path is not the same _and_ is hardcoded in the binary.)

2. Copy the resulted binary as /usr/lib/libruby.1.dylib. Make a backup of the
   previous version before.

Example, for an Intel machine:

$ tar -xzf misc/libruby.1.dylib-tiger-i386.tar.gz
$ sudo mv /usr/lib/libruby.1.dylib /usr/lib/libruby.1.dylib.old
$ sudo mv misc/libruby.1.dylib-tiger-i386 /usr/lib/libruby.1.dylib

== Manually Patching ==

ruby_thread_hooks.diff is the patch that needs to be applied to the Ruby 
interpreter. 

The patch can be theoretically applied to any Ruby 1.8.x release (works fine
with 1.8.6 and even with the latest patchlevel releases).

Versions of Ruby below 1.8.x are not supported.

The patch doesn't need to be applied before building RubyCocoa.

Example:

$ tar -xzf ruby-1.8.x.tar.gz
$ cd ruby-1.8.x
$ patch -p0 </path/to/ruby_thread_hooks.diff
$ ./configure --enable-shared --enable-pthread
$ make
$ sudo make install
