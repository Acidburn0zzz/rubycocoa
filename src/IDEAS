Purpose and Ideas for this Branch

* Allow transparent packaging.  Developers need only worry about creating their application 
  and basic configuration not the innards of packaging and releasing. 

  config.objc_frameworks << ['Webkit', 'Quartz']
  config.active_record = true
  config.include_dirs << %w(models controllers lib)

* Allow Apps running in debug mode to use code from your working directory.  No need to 
  continuously rebuild your application when just changing a few lines of Ruby.
* When in debug mode and using ActiveRecord, allow database to reside in your working 
  directory for easy access instead of buried in your users Application Support path.
* Load database config from config/database.yml
* Remove what Xcode dependencies we can.  (e.g. No need to add directories to Xcode)
